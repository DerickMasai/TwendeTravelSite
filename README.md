## About

This is a travel website made entirely from scratch while employing minimal design coupled with plenty of white space to ensure the content breathes and visual flow is consistent during scroll.

## Hero Section

The Hero section employs a Typewriting Effect achieved using vanilla JS to display the 3 ideals the site is trying to put forth to the user in a way that embraces the minimalistic approach mentioned while keeping it interesting for the user.

## Quotes Section (Random on load)

Using PHP/MySQL, I was able to display random quotes from a database created for this purpose. This is done by selecting all quote IDs in the table, adding them to an array, randomly selecting an array index which then provides an ID and then displaying the quote and author associated with said ID.

## Contact Page (AJAX Requests)

On the Contact page, I have employed AJAX requests to send the contact form data to the database asynchronously for minimal UX disruption. Form error responses are also active thanks to vanilla JS while the confirmation message is triggered via jQuery + AJAX.
